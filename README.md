<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Stephanie Fakar</h1>
I’m a data analyst with a background in computer science and a growing passion for turning raw data into actionable insights. Recently, I completed a Data Analysis Bootcamp with Alex the Analyst, where I gained hands-on experience in: 
  
  - 📊 Data Visualisation: Creating clear, compelling visuals using Excel, Tableau, and Power BI,
  - 🗄️ Databases: Querying, cleaning, and managing data with MySQL,
  - 📈 Analytics: Preprocessing, analysing,
  - and interpreting datasets to support data-driven decisions.
    
 I thrive on solving complex problems, uncovering trends, and building dashboards that make data easy to understand. My goal is to continually improve my technical expertise by applying analytics to real-world projects.
🌱 Currently, I’m working on personal projects to sharpen my skills and showcase my portfolio here on GitHub. I believe in the power of continuous learning, and I'm always seeking new challenges to grow professionally.
